## Part 1

### Question 1

```{r}
ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100) +
  labs(
    x = "Population density",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Population density of midwesten counties",
    subtitle = "Binwidth = 100"
  )

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(
    x = "Population density",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Population density of midwesten counties",
    subtitle = "Binwidth = 1000"
  )

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10000) +
  labs(
    x = "Population density",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Population density of midwesten counties",
    subtitle = "Binwidth = 10000"
  )

ggplot(midwest, aes(x = popdensity)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100000) +
  labs(
    x = "Population density",
    y = "Count",
    title = "Population density of midwesten counties",
    subtitle = "Binwidth = 100000"
  )
```

Binwidth 1000 is most appropriate for this data because the data is grouped in a sufficient ranges to see patterns in the overall set. Any smaller or bigger will have the data distribution be convoluted and its shape ambiguous.
